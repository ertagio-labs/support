# Register Setup

!!!warning
Before getting started, please get the latest version from the [dashboard](https://ertagio.com/login)
!!!


## Installation

The first thing you should do is import Register into your game. Please ensure the *owner* of the Register license is the *owner* of the Roblox group / game. *If this is not the case, reach out to our [support team](https://discord.com/channels/1367822927281782784/1384067175911784520) to transfer your license.* Once imported, press CTRL+U and remove Register's box. Next, ensure you do the following:
* Enable HTTP Requests and API Services by going to **Game Settings > Security** and turning on **"Allow HTTP Requests" and "Enable Studio Access to API Services"**
* Enable LoadString by going to **ServerScriptService > Properties** and turning on **"LoadStringEnabled"**
    * Enabling LoadString carries risks, especially if not used carefully. As long as your game has no suspicious code, it should be secure. Please reach out to our [support team](https://discord.com/channels/1367822927281782784/1384067175911784520) if you have concerns.
* Move the **"Card"** tool to **StarterPack** (or wherever you keep your tools)
    * Register is compatible with *Ertagio card* and *JSM card* at this time.
